		<p>TD Platinum Travel Visa Card has an annual fee of $89, plus $35 for the first additional cardholder and free for subsequent additional cardholders.</p>
		<p> The minimum credit limit for this card is $1,000, and there is no income restriction which is same as the TD Rewards Visa Card. If you are age 18 or above, you are qualified to apply for this card!</p>
		<p> This card gives you more perks and benifits than the TD Rewards Cisa Card. This card can be a great choice for college students, young graduates or people who love to travel or looking for a decent annual fee travel card. </p>
		<p> You can earn 3 TD rewards points for every $1 in grocery purchases and regular bill payments.
		You can earn 5 TD rewards points for every $1 in travel purchases made with your card through ExpediaForTD.com, and earn 1 TD rewards point for every $1 on all other purchases made with this card. </p>
		<p>You can get a welcome bonus of 15,000 TD rewards points plus if you make another $1,000 purchase with this card within 90 days of account opening, you can also get an additional 45,000 TD points. That's
		equivalent of $420! Assuming your average monthly spend is $1,000, you could end up earn 93,600 TD rewards points (welcome bonus included), that's a travel value of $468, which can offsets almost 5 annual fees.
